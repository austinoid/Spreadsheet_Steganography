# Spreadsheet Steganography
> Hide Numeric Data in Plain Sight

This is really just a small example of my Excel VBA skills, but you might find it useful.
This Excel workbook provides a kind of steganography to hide numeric sequences in plain sight.
This utility will hide number sequences within a grid of semi-random digits.
Carry around a hard-copy or soft-copy document containing those lock codes you can never remember.

## Installing / Getting started

After running appropriate virus scan on the file, 
you will probably need to instruct Excel to run the contained macros and content.

## Features

Generates a grid of digits to hide numeric sequences in plain sight.
* Allows the secret digits to be placed in grid in whatever pattern the user desires.
* Mark selected grid cells (to mark pattern boundaries) with random colors.
* Mark selected grid cells (to mark pattern boundaries) with bold font.
* Fill unused cells with semi-random digits.
